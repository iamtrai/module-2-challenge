# Traivon Terry Portfolio Website

## Description

This website was coded from scratch and will be deployed as a portoflio for myself. The site will be updated with various projects as I continue my education and work, and the overall style and design may change. The nav bar links scroll the UI to the corresponding areas on the page, and the work images ar anchored to the projects they are labeled with (currently only the Horiseon site with more to come soon.).
